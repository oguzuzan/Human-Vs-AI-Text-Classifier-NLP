Project Evaluation and Results:

Our project can be regarded as an effort to compare the capabilities of AI and human text classification. Analyses conducted indicate that the artificial intelligence models used demonstrated acceptable performance in accurately classifying certain text categories.

Certainly, there are some limitations to the project. In particular, factors such as limited data sets and inadequate representation of certain text categories may restrict the generalizability of the results obtained.

To overcome the limitations encountered in our project and enhance the generalizability of the findings, future studies could utilize a more comprehensive data set. Additionally, considering that artificial intelligence models may need further optimization, forward-looking steps could be taken to improve the model's performance.
